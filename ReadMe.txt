# Computation 3 Final Project

This is a quick READ ME File with the objective of giving a preview and the necessary instructions for the installation
and launch of the game.

Game's notable features:
- Single Player Mode (Car Racing)
- Multiplayer Mode
- Shop available for both modes (Single Player works with the score as the credits to buy different cars;
   On Multiplayer both players can choose the cars they want to use independently of score)
- 4 Power Ups available in both game modes: (Invincibility, Slowing Down Time, Size Reduction and Shooting Power up)
- Single Player and Player 1 use WASD for controls, W and S control the speed of the incoming cars - more details on
  Instructions Menu in game

We used a variety of funny audio files that play when selecting cars from the shop and for a bit of a warning for
headphone users: some are a bit loud xD
