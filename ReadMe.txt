# 🚗 Car Racer Game (Computation III Final Project)

Welcome to our Car Racer game! This project was developed as a final assignment for Computation III, aimed at demonstrating skills in object-oriented programming and game development using Pygame. Below you’ll find details on game features, installation instructions, and more.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds upon a basic car racing game developed during practical classes, with the addition of creative enhancements and customizations. Players can enjoy both single and multiplayer modes, with dynamic gameplay enhanced by various power-ups and an improved user interface. The game structure follows an object-oriented approach and is designed to be modular and extendable.

### Notable Features
- **Single-Player Mode**: Engage in a solo racing experience.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Race against a friend on the same screen!
- **Custom Shop**: Players can select cars in single-player mode based on score credits, while in multiplayer mode, each player can independently choose their car.
- **Power-Ups**: The game includes four unique power-ups that enhance the gameplay:
  - **Invincibility**: Temporary immunity to obstacles.
  - **Slow Motion**: Reduces the speed of incoming traffic, giving players more reaction time.
  - **Size Reduction**: Temporarily shrinks the car, making it easier to navigate.
  - **Shooting Ability**: Grants players the ability to shoot obstacles on the track.
- **Enhanced UI**: The game interface has been customized for a smooth and engaging experience.
- **Instructions Panel**: Includes game rules, power-up explanations, and control instructions.

### Controls
- **Single Player / Player 1**: `WASD` keys (with `W` and `S` adjusting car speed).
- **Player 2 (Multiplayer Mode)**: Refer to the in-game Instructions Menu for details.
